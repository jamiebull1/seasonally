# seasonally
A site collecting scraping recipes and presenting them when ingredients
are in season.

Development plan is to add more sources since currently we only have
info from BBC Good Food and allrecipes.co.uk.

### Database admin

Need to run `python api/init_db.py` when setting up a new database. This populates all the months and products which are in season in those months.
